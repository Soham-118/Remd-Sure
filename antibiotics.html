                <li>Antibiotics work by killing bacteria and preventing them from multiplying. </li>
                <li>Common antibiotics include gentamicin, cephalexin, ertapenem, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.</li>
                <li>They include a range of powerful drugs used to treat diseases caused by bacteria.</li>
                <li>Antibiotics cannot treat viral infections, such as cold, flu, and most coughs.</li>
                <li>This article explains what antibiotics are, how they work, potential side effects, and antibiotic resistance.</li>

                        <li><strong>Product Information and Benefits</strong></li>
                        <p>Azithromycin is used to treat certain bacterial infections, 
                            such as bronchitis; pneumonia; sexually transmitted diseases (STD); and infections 
                            of the ears, lungs, sinuses, skin, throat, and reproductive organs. 
                            Azithromycin also is used to treat or prevent disseminated 
                            Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection 
                            [a type of lung infection that often affects people with human immunodeficiency 
                            virus (HIV)]. Azithromycin is in a class of medications called macrolide antibiotics. 
                            It works by stopping the growth of bacteria.
                            Antibiotics such as azithromycin will not work for colds, flu, or other viral 
                            infections. Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of 
                            getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.
